+NVIDIA EGLStream-based Weston version 4.0
+-----------------------------------------
+
+This branch includes NVIDIA EGLStream patches on top of
+Weston 4.0.
+
+* Known issues:
+
+  - Bad interactions with XDG Shell v6 preventing
+    clients that implement the new interface from
+    starting
+
+    Fixed if using wl_eglstream_controller from commit:
+
+      a044287897d3646440644555f7ac1d756e39e0d2 compositor: Process stream attach requests with wl_eglstream_controller
+
+      (Needs libnvidia-egl-wayland.so >= 1.0.2 - https://github.com/NVIDIA/egl-wayland)
+
+    Fixed in 'weston-simple-egl' with commit:
+
+      ce015e27839809ed4d602dd8d977f2df770b0921 simple-egl: Do not set EGL up until XDG setup is complete
